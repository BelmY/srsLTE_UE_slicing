srsLTE is a free and open-source LTE software suite developed by SRS (www.softwareradiosystems.com). 

This is a modified version of [srsLTE] (https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE) that includes slicing support in the User Equipment.

It includes:
  * **srsUE**
    * Modified version of the UE enabling the usage of multiple slices for a unique UE, creating individual virtual interfaces per slice.

srsLTE is released under the AGPLv3 license and uses software from the OpenLTE project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlte) for some security functions and for RRC/NAS message parsing.

More information provided in the official srsLTE repository [srsLTE repo] (https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE)
